## Squirro Frontend Coding Challenge

Because https://restcountries.eu/ isn't working for some reason, I used a similar api https://countryflagsapi.com

I used React + Hooks. I tried to make it as simple as I can, because I prefer clean code over extra show off stuff.
I made it a little responsive aligning the elements vertically after a certain screen width. I seperate the data of each BookStore once the Store is render, as props.
